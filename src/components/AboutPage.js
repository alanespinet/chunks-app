        <p><strong>Policy note from the author (Alan Espinet):</strong> This applicaction is a case of study; a practice project I created ONLY with the objectives of practicing, learning and studing React JS.</p>

        <p>It is NOT the application’s goal to provide an Online Service on any kind. If a user (or users) find it and want to use it, I am ok with the situation, but I will NOT be responsable of which use those users give to the application. I will NOT check any user’s recorded data unless someone explicitly contacts me through my website and makes me know that something could be wrong.</p>
